# Testing

## Performance in ramdomised graphs

Tests were (will be) performed using the automated testing in the program. 
To compare the performance of the algorithms in different kind of graphs, 
graphs with different amounts of nodes, arcs per nodes and maximum distances 
between the nodes were tested. 

The tests can all be easily reproduced with the automated testing. While the 
generated graphs will be different each time, large enough sample sizes will 
make up for the it to show the differences of the algorithms.
