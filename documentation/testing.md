# Testing

## Performance in ramdomised graphs

Tests were (will be) performed using the automated testing in the program. 
To compare the performance of the algorithms in different kind of graphs, 
graphs with different amounts of nodes, arcs per nodes and maximum distances 
between the nodes were tested.
