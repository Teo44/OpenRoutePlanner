# Weekly report 1

## What was done

* Repository created
* Added specifications to documentation
* Created the Java project
* Looked into different shortest path algorithms
* Looked into possible ways to get data for finding shortest paths

## Issues

I don't yet have a  clear plan on how to get openstreetmap data into a form that can be used by the algorithms, but it seems the downloadable XML-files can be interpreted as a graph for pathfinding purposes.

## Plan for the next week

Program a way to extract usable data from the openstreetmap XML-files and implement Dijkstra using Java datastructures. 

Time spent: 3 hours
