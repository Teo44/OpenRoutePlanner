# Weekly report 1

## What was done

* Added specifications to documentation
* Looked into different shortest path algorithms to use
* Started work on a text UI and openstreetmap XML parsing

## Issues

I'm not sure if openstreetmap's XML files are a good way to get data for the program, but so far it seems like they will do the job.

## Plan for the next week

* Functional XML parsing
* Basic Dijkstra implementation

Time spent: 5 hours
