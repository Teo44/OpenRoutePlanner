# Weekly report 2

## What was done

* OSM XML file parsing to graphs
* Basic Dijkstra's algorithm using Java data structures
* Started working on A*, currently little broken and slower 
than Dijkstra due to slow heuristic calculations
* Text UI, user can define the file to parse, the type of ways 
to include and calculate shortest distance and route between nodes.
* Unit testing for the parser and Dijkstra

## Issues

Jacoco keeps giving "Skipping JaCoCo execution due to missing execution data file." 
error, can't figure it out.

## Plan for next week
* Fix and finish A*
* Start working on IDA*
* Start replacing Java's datastructures with own implementations
* Betterments to the UI?
