# Weekly report 4

## What was done

* Replaced Java hashmap with own implementation
* OSM parser optimisation
* (kind of) functional IDA*
* Added automated, customisable testing of the algorithms
* UI improvements: an actual menu, options, handling of invalid inputs

## Issues

IDA* is A LOT slower than Dijkstra and A* in most cases, something 
wrong with the implementation. 

Recording results for performance testing is also on hold until 
IDA* is fixed.

## Plan for next week

* Random generation of different kinds of graphs for further testing
