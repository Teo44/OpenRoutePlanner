# Weekly report 4

## What was done

* Replaced Java hashmap with own implementation
* OSM parser optimisation
* Functional IDA*
* Added automated, customisable testing of the algorithms

## Issues

IDA* is A LOT slower than Dijkstra and A* in many cases, not 
sure if thats just the nature of the algorithm or if there is 
something wrong with the implementation.

## Plan for next week
